            <a name="colorCorrector"><h4 class="midTitle">The Color Corrector Class</h4></a>
            <p>
                <code><b>public class ColorCorrector</b></code><br>
                An essential component in the process of solving a cube by robot,
                is achieving a reliable image of the cube's colors. <br>
                The ColorCorrector class is intended to do exactly that! It corrects color scanning errors
                (which often occur due to the sensitive and unideal color sensors)
                and provides a highly reliable description of the cube's colors (to be safely used by the algorithm).<br>
                The NXT's color sensor has difficulties to distinguish between Red and Orange colors. <br>
                Since we are able to determine the colors at each of the cube's corners by it's neighbors,
                we can detect and correct any Red/Orange mix up at the corners.
                This is how the class represents the corner:
            <pre>
                     +--------+--------+
                     |        |        |
                     | corner | right  |
                     |        |        |
                     |        |        |

                     +--------+

            Whereas each of the squares above belong to another cube's face.

                Provides a smart and compact Cube object which holds the cube’s data: Faces, colors and
                orientations<br>
                Managing changes in the cube’s orientations caused by rotations and flips (performed by the robot)
            </p>

            <a name="middleMan"><h5>The Middle Man...</h5></a>
            <p>
                The Cube.java class acts as the "middle man" between the Robot and the Algorithm:
                <br>The main.java program creates the Cube object and passes it on to the Algorithm.
                <br>The algorithm utilizes the Cube's functionality to read the Cube's colors and manipulate the Cube's
                faces, while the Cube transforms these requests to Robot actions.
                <br>The advantage is the Cube's ability to keep track of the changing orientations whenever the Robot
                rotates and flips the Cube.
            </p>

            <a name="interfaces"><h5>Public Interfaces</h5></a>
            <p>The following 'ICube' and 'IFace' interfaces expose the public methods of the cube,
            <br>which provide a safe and efficient way to manipulate the cube while tracking state changes.</p>
            <p>The public methods were carefully planned to expose only the exact functionality required for the client (namely
                the Algorithm class)
                <br>while keeping things 'simple' as possible.</p>
<p>The IFace interface, which represents each of the six cube faces:
<pre class="CodeBox"><code>
public interface IFace {
   /*
    * Returns the color of a position (row, col) in a face
    */
    public Colors getColor(int i, int j);

    /*
     * Represents a turn of the face in a desired direction.
     * It uses the dynamic orientation and the actions table to derive
     * the number of flips and rotation needed in order to bring this face to the bottom.
     * after this face is brought to the bottom, it is turn in the desired direction.
     * @param direction The direction that the face should turn
     */
    public void turn(Direction direction);
}
</code></pre></p>
<p>The ICube interface, which represents the entire cube:
<pre class="CodeBox"><code>
public interface ICube {
/*
 * returns the face which is currently in the orientation requested (UP, DOWN, LEFT, ...)
 */
IFace getFace(Orientation orientation);

/*
 * Scan and set the cube colors.
 * The method is first to scan all of the cube's colors in RGB mode,
 * and calculate their HSV representation as well as their distance from
 * the calibrated white RGB.
 * Second, sort all the colors by their white distance (since white doesn't have
 * meaningful Hue value), and place them on the cube.
 * Last, sort all the colors by their Hue value and place them on the cube
 * according to their Hue value.
 */
void setColors();

}
</code></pre></p>


            <a name="representation"><h5>Cube Representation</h5></a>
            <p>
                The Cube object is the representation of the Rubik's Cube as provided to the Algorithm class
                for calculating the required steps to reach a full solution.<br>
                A Cube object is consisted of six Face objects, where each one provides the functionality of a 'face turn'
                as well as the option of reading all face's colors.<br>
                One of the interesting challenges regarding the manipulations of the cube,
                arises from the fact that the robot can only rotate the bottom cube's face (placed on it's tray),
                while the algorithm may instruct to turn any of the cube's faces at each step.
                As consequence, the Robot often flips and rotates the whole cube in order to position the selected face
                as the bottom face.
                To bridge this gap, we let the algorithm act as if the cube is static (initial orientations never change),
                while translating each 'static' face orientation selection (Up, Down, etc.) to the 'dynamic' actual
                orientation of the selected face.<br>
                This process is implemented efficiently by the Cube class, by using an Orientations matrix and an Actions array
                which help keeping track of the 'dynamic' orientation of each of the cube's faces.
            </p>

            <a name="orientations"><h5>Cube Orientations</h5></a>
            <br><img width="200" src="./resources/rubikFlat.png"><br>

<p>The Orientations Matrix:
    <br> Following every rotation and flip of the cube executed by the robot, the cube's orientations change (i.e. 'UP' face may become 'DOWN', etc.)
    <br> The Orientations Matrix is a static matrix which represent the new position of every face
    <br> once any face is set to be the bottom face ('DOWN' orientation).
    <br> The faces are listed in the following order: 0 = Up, 1 = Right, 2 = Front, 3 = Down, 4 = Left, 5 = Back
    <br> <u>Example of use:</u>
    <br> Suppose we need to set the current 'FRONT' face to be the bottom ('DOWN') face,
    <br> in order to know how this action affects the other faces, we should go to the 2nd row of
    <br> the matrix (as listed above: 2 = FRONT), and we will find the new positions of the other faces:
    <br> position 0 has the value L -> indicates that the UP face (0 = UP) becomes the LEFT face.
    <br> position 1 has the value F -> indicates that the RIGHT face (1 = RIGHT) becomes the FRONT face, etc.
    <br> in conclusion we got these transforms: U->L , R->F , F->D , D->R, L->B , B->U
    <br> this matrix help us to determine the positions of the faces in any transition.
<pre class="CodeBox"><code>
private static final Orientation[][] ORIENTATION_MAT = {
{ Orientation.D, Orientation.L, Orientation.F, Orientation.U, Orientation.R, Orientation.B },
{ Orientation.L, Orientation.D, Orientation.B, Orientation.R, Orientation.U, Orientation.F },
{ Orientation.L, Orientation.F, Orientation.D, Orientation.R, Orientation.B, Orientation.U },
{ Orientation.U, Orientation.R, Orientation.F, Orientation.D, Orientation.L, Orientation.B },
{ Orientation.L, Orientation.U, Orientation.F, Orientation.R, Orientation.D, Orientation.B },
{ Orientation.L, Orientation.B, Orientation.U, Orientation.R, Orientation.F, Orientation.D } };
</code></pre></p>

            <p>
                Thanks to the 'Orientations Matrix' the routine of updating the new orientations of the faces after
                a transition of the cube, becomes a simple quick task -
                <br>The following method receives the current orientation of the face that was just set to the bottom,
                and performs required orientations updates to all six faces:
<pre class="CodeBox"><code>
void updateOrientations(Orientation orientation) {
Orientation[] newOrientations = ORIENTATION_MAT[orientation.getValue()];
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        faces[i].dynamicOrientation = newOrientations[faces[i].dynamicOrientation.getValue()];
    }
}
</code></pre></p>

            <p>The Action class, holds the required cube flips and turns
    to set a selected face as the bottom face:
<pre class="CodeBox"><code>
public class Action {

    public FlipMethod flips;
    public Direction direction;

    public Action(FlipMethod flips, Direction direction) {
    this.flips = flips;
    this.direction = direction;
    }
}
</code></pre></p>

<p>The 'Actions' Array:<br>
    specifies the flips and rotations that the robot should execute on the cube,
    to set the selected face as the bottom face (the only face that can be turned):
    <br>For instance, in order to turn the 'UP' face by 90 degrees clockwise, the Robot must first flip the cube twice
    to set the 'UP' face as the bottom, and then turn the face by 90 degrees counterclockwise.
    <br> Another example: in order to set the FRONT face as the bottom,
    the Robot should rotate the cube left and then perform a flip.
    <br>This action is stored on the actions array at position 2 (since 2 = FRONT): {FlipMethod.SINGLE, Direction.LEFT}
<pre class="CodeBox"><code>
actions[Orientation.U.getValue()] = new Action(FlipMethod.DOUBLE, Direction.NONE);
actions[Orientation.D.getValue()] = new Action(FlipMethod.NONE, Direction.NONE);
actions[Orientation.F.getValue()] = new Action(FlipMethod.SINGLE, Direction.LEFT);
actions[Orientation.B.getValue()] = new Action(FlipMethod.SINGLE, Direction.RIGHT);
actions[Orientation.R.getValue()] = new Action(FlipMethod.SINGLE, Direction.MIRROR);
actions[Orientation.L.getValue()] = new Action(FlipMethod.SINGLE, Direction.NONE);
</code></pre></p>

            <TODO>TODO...</TODO>
            <p>Present the considerations that led to the two-phase algorithm</p>
            <p>Following our research on Rubik’s cube solving algorithms, we chose the following two-phase
                algorithm.</p>
            <a name="twoPhaseAlgo"><h5>2-Phase Algorithm</h5></a>
            <p>
                We are using the two-phase algorithm, introduced by Herbert Kociemba in 1991-1992.
                <img style="float: right; margin-right: 300px" width="80"
                     src="https://www.speedsolving.com/interviews/interview-herbertk.jpg"><br>
                The problem of solving the cube is translated into a shortest path in a graph problem, <br>
                where the nodes are the different states of the cube, and there is an edge between two nodes <br>
                if one state can be reached from the other by turning one face of the cube.
            </p>
            <a name="algoRep"><h5>Cube Representation</h5></a>
            <p>
                Cube’s state is represented using a set of coordinates, driven from it's corners and edges permutations
                and orientations compared to a solved cube.<br>
                The corners and edges permutations and orientations tells us how to move and rotate each corner and how to move and flip each edge
                in order to reach a given cube from a solved cube.<br>
                In this way, a cube representation can be interpreted as a function. Given an initial cube state,
                the algorithm implicitly finds the inverse cube\function to it.
            </p>
            <a name="solution"><h5>Searching For Solution</h5></a>
            <p>Searching for the solution is done in two phases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The algorithm first tries to find a path from cube’s initial state to one of the states that can be
                    reached
                    from a solved cube using only the following moves: U, D, R2, L2 F2, B2.
                </li>
                <li>Once we found a path, the algorithm tries to find a path from the current state to the solved cube,
                    using only the moves mentioned above.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The path search in the graph is done using the IDA* algorithm. Finding a shortest path in a graph can be
                done using a BFS-like tree search, but it requires a lot of memory. Using DFS-like tree search will help
                us finding a path, but not the shortest one. Therefore, the two-phase algorithm uses an iterative
                deepening search. Iterative deepening (ID) means a DFS search is performed iteratively for a growing
                tree depth. The search uses a heuristic function to stop searching in a specific branch when the
                solution cannot be found with the given state and depth. The heuristic function gives a lower bound on
                the number of moves required to reach from a state to the goal state.
            </p>
            <a name="implementation"><h5>The Implementation</h5></a>
            <p>
                Our implementation is based on Kociemba’s implementation for this algorithm, which he published in his
                site:
                <a href="http://kociemba.org/cube.htm">http://kociemba.org/cube.htm</a><br>
                It implements the two-phase algorithm in a simple form, and does not use
                symmetry for better performance. <br>Moreover, the implementation is not finding the shortest solution.
                It
                finds a short solution for the first phase, and then tries to find a short solution from current state
                to the solved cube, so the combination of the two is not necessarily the shortest solution.
            </p>

            <a name="modifications"><h5>Our Modifications</h5></a>
            <p>We also added the ability to select a pattern, so that preforming the set of moves returned by the
                algorithm will produce a cube with the selected pattern.
                To allow the pattern ability, we calculate the inverse cube of the pattern, multiply it by the given
                cube and then find a solution for the result cube.
                (You can think of multiplying cube A by B like taking a set of moves that transform a solved cube into B
                cube and perform them on A cube).
                The algorithm finds a solution for the resulted cube, which is a set
                of moves to create its reverse cube from a solved cube. This reverse cube is the multiplication of the
                reverse of the original cube and the pattern, so applying the resulted set of moves on the cube brings
                us from the initial cube to a solved cube and then to the patterned cube (this is not done one after the
                other, this is just an easier way to understand what happens).
                Exploring and understanding the algorithm was one of the major parts of our project, and we believe it
                was quite educational (and most definitely fun).
